        <td><h3>Create a Study Schedule</h3></td>
        <td>
          Plan your study time in advance and stick to it. Break your study
          sessions into manageable chunks and include short breaks to avoid
          burnout.
        </td>

      <tr>
        <td><h3>Find a Good Study Space</h3></td>
        <td>
          Choose a quiet, well-lit place where you can concentrate without
          distractions. Make sure it's comfortable and has all the materials you
          need.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><h3>Use Active Learning Techniques</h3></td>
        <td>
          Engage with the material by summarizing information in your own words,
          teaching it to someone else, or creating flashcards. This helps
          reinforce your understanding.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><h3>Stay Organized</h3></td>
        <td>
          Keep your notes, assignments, and study materials organized. Use a
          planner or digital tools to track deadlines and important dates.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><h3>Take Regular Breaks</h3></td>
        <td>
          Studying for long periods without breaks can be counterproductive. Use
          techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of studying
          followed by a 5-minute break) to stay fresh.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><h3>Practice Past Papers</h3></td>
        <td>
          If you're preparing for exams, practice with past papers or sample
          questions. This helps you get familiar with the format and identify
          areas where you need more practice.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><h3>Stay Healthy</h3></td>
        <td>
          Don't forget to take care of your physical and mental health. Get
          enough sleep, eat nutritious meals, and exercise regularly to keep
          your mind and body in good shape.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><h3>Ask for Help</h3></td>
        <td>
          If you're struggling with a topic, don't hesitate to ask your
          teachers, classmates, or look for online resources. Sometimes a
          different perspective can make things clearer.
